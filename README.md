Design, Analysis and Optimisation of Dielectric Elastomer Generators for Wave Energy Conversion Systems

This project investigates the design, analysis and optimisation of dielectric elastomer generators (DEGs) for
integration into wave energy conversion (WEC) systems, through addressing the increasing need for sus-
tainable and efficient renewable energy systems. DEGs, as flexible and deformable capacitors, convert me-
chanical energy from wave motion into electrical energy through utilising the changing capacitances within
the DEG through stretching cycles. This study explores the various DEG architectures before selecting three
different deformation modes - equibiaxial, pure-shear and conical - these are then evaluated based on their
capacitances, voltages needed to effectively prime the DEGs and their outputted energy generation potential
under different configurations. By exploring different material options such as natural rubber, synthetic rub-
ber, acrylic, silicone and emerging silicone composite, the project identifies key material parameters which
can influence the energy generation potential and efficiency as well as durability, stretchability, stiffness and
dielectric performance.
Through detailed analysis, this project highlights the advantages of different DEG-based WECs, includ-
ing adaptability to varying wave conditions, large conversion efficiencies, reduced mechanical complexity
and scalability of DEGs. The research into this emerging technology emphasises the role of innovative DEG
architectures and configurations, material selection, and advanced methodologies in achieving sustainable
and efficient wave energy harvesting. Finally, it evaluates the potential for implementing stacked DEG-based
WECs into the marine environment through the design of a theoretical wave energy farm to demonstrate the
practical and scalable applications of DEGs.
